# Google-Cloud-Projects-

DevOpsPipeline Project
•Implemented a streamlined deployment pipeline using Cloud Source Repositories, Docker, and Cloud Build for automating the deployment of a Flask application, resulting in faster and more efficient releases, improved code quality and consistency, and reduced deployment errors.


SoccerMatchPredicationBigqueryML Project

•	Developed and deployed advanced machine learning models in BigQuery using standard SQL queries to predict soccer match outcomes with high accuracy and precision.Did this as a side project to assist me in sports fantasy. Utilized various machine learning techniques such as regression analysis, decision trees, and neural networks to optimize the models for improved performance. Additionally, used data visualization tools such as Tableau to present the results in a clear and actionable format to add on to the project

•	Leveraged BigQuery and BigQuery ML to analyze and predict outcomes in soccer matches by loading data from Cloud Storage, writing and executing complex queries, and training a machine learning model using historical soccer event data. Utilized the model to evaluate and predict the likelihood of impressive goals in the World Cup, providing valuable insights and predictions for the success of teams and players.

SpannerCloudGame Project

•	Developed a multiplayer game in Google Cloud utilizing Go for the REST API, Spanner Database for player data storage, and Locust.io for load testing and performance optimization. The game features user registration and authentication, in-game item purchases and trading, and real-time interaction between players


•	Created four Go services that interact with a regional Spanner database. The first two services, profile-service and matchmaking-service, enable players to sign up and start playing. The second pair of services, item-service and tradepost-service, enable players to acquire items and money, and then list items on the trading post for other players to purchase.

•	Generated data leveraging the Python load framework Locust.io to simulate players signing up and playing games to obtain games_played and games_won statistics. Also allowed players to acquire money and items through the course of "game play". Players can then list items for sale on a tradepost, where other players with enough money can purchase those items.

•	Query Spanner to determine how many players are playing, statistics about players' games won versus games played, players' account balances and number of items, and statistics about trade orders that are open or have been filled.

Built a VPN Between Google Cloud and AWS with Terraform
• Implemented a secure and scalable VPN connection between Google Cloud and AWS using Terraform, which enabled seamless communication and data transfer between the two platforms, reducing the need for manual configuration and increasing efficiency and reliability. Additionally, I set up monitoring and alerting for the VPN connection using Cloudwatch and configured automatic failover to ensure high availability of the connection. This solution improved the overall performance and security of the network infrastructure.

•Deployed virtual machine (VM) instances into custom virtual private cloud (VPC) networks in Google Cloud and AWS. T

•Then deploy supporting infrastructure to construct a VPN connection with two Internet Protocol security (IPsec) tunnels between the Google Cloud and AWS VPC network to create  secure, private, site-to-site connection between Google Cloud and AWS using VPN.
